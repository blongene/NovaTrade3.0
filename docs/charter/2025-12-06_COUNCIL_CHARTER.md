# NovaTrade Council Charter
## Phase 20 Edition – Unified Governance Framework

This Charter defines the governing voices (“The Council”) that shape, direct, and safeguard the NovaTrade Autonomous Engine.  
Each voice expresses an archetypal intelligence with a specific domain of influence, and together they form the balanced governance needed for responsible autonomy.

The Council does not replace the Captain.  
It operationalizes the Captain’s will.

Soul → Path → Mind → Heart → Light → Watcher → Hands → Action

Each voice influences the final action, but none override the Soul.
