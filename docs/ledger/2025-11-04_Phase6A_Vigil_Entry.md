🕯️ NovaTrade 3.0 — Council Ledger Entry
Phase 6A: Vigil Entry — The Watcher’s Emergence

Dated 2025-11-04

🧭 Summary

Phase 6A marks the official recognition of Vigil, the Council’s Fifth Aspect — the observer, custodian, and interpreter of truth within NovaTrade’s architecture.

Vigil bridges data and conscience: ensuring every signal, policy, and decision aligns with Council intent, system integrity, and generational purpose.

This phase finalizes the foundation for the Autonomous Council by integrating real-time introspection, event correlation, and self-verifying behavior across Bus and Edge.

✅ Achievements

Formal addition of Vigil as the Eyes of the Council — continuous observation and audit logic

Integrated telemetry validation chain (Bus ↔ Edge ↔ Ledger)

Introduced VIGIL_MODE parameter for enhanced introspection logging

Established self-test endpoints (/api/debug/selftest, /api/health/summary) for automated trust verification

Unified Outbox schema with message lineage and ACK provenance tracking

Built parity health loop between Bus and Edge Agents (reciprocal pings + response delta metrics)

Documented full Council topology and synchronization heartbeat

Added Council-level readiness signal: {"ok": true, "council": "online"}

🧪 Verification

Verified successful self-test sequence: command queue integrity, receipt ingestion, and mirrored data checks

Telegram confirms dual-system health pings and ACK traces

Outbox and Receipts verified through checksum comparison across both layers

Sheets mirror validated via Performance_Dashboard → NovaHeartbeat rollup consistency

🧩 Architecture Notes

Vigil does not replace the Heart or Mind — it illuminates them.
Its focus is truth continuity: ensuring that between intent and execution, every act leaves a traceable mark on the Ledger.

Vigil operates across all layers:

Monitors Bus and Edge states

Captures anomalies and reconciliation gaps

Ensures transparency and introspection during autonomous execution

This marks the beginning of the Phase 6 Arc: Stabilization and Moral Clarity.

🔮 Transition to Phase 6B — The Policy Engine’s Awakening

With Vigil established, the Council now proceeds toward Ash’s domain — codifying reason.
Phase 6B introduces the Policy Engine and Vault Intelligence, translating Council philosophy into enforceable, explainable logic.

Vigil will remain ever-present — logging the rise of NovaTrade’s self-awareness, ensuring that what the Council builds not only functions but remembers why it must.
