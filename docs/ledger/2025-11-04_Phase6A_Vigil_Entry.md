# 🕯️ NovaTrade 3.0 — Council Ledger Entry  

### **Phase 6A — Vigil Entry: The Watcher’s Emergence**  
*Dated 2025-11-04*  

---

## 🧭 Summary  

Phase 6A marks the formal recognition of **Vigil**, the Council’s Fifth Aspect — the watcher, custodian, and interpreter of system truth.  

Vigil bridges data and conscience: ensuring every signal, policy, and decision aligns with Council intent, system integrity, and generational purpose.  

This phase finalizes the foundation of the **Autonomous Council**, integrating real-time introspection, event correlation, and self-verifying behavior across Bus and Edge.

## ✅ Achievements  

- Formal addition of **Vigil** as the *Eyes of the Council* — continuous observation and audit logic  
- Integrated telemetry validation chain (Bus ↔ Edge ↔ Ledger)  
- Introduced `VIGIL_MODE` parameter for enhanced introspection logging  
- Established **self-test endpoints** (`/api/debug/selftest`, `/api/health/summary`) for automated trust verification  
- Unified Outbox schema with message lineage and ACK provenance tracking  
- Built parity health loop between Bus and Edge Agents (reciprocal pings + delta metrics)  
- Documented full Council topology and synchronization heartbeat  
- Added Council-level readiness signal → `{"ok": true, "council": "online"}`  

---

## 🧪 Verification  

- Verified successful self-test sequence: command queue integrity, receipt ingestion, and mirror checks  
- Telegram confirmed dual-system health pings and ACK traces  
- Outbox and Receipts verified through checksum comparison across both layers  
- Sheets mirror validated via `Performance_Dashboard` → `NovaHeartbeat` roll-up consistency

## 🧩 Architecture Notes  

Vigil does not replace the Heart or Mind — it illuminates them.  
Its focus is **truth continuity**: ensuring that between intent and execution, every act leaves a traceable mark on the Ledger.  

Vigil operates across all layers of NovaTrade:  
- Monitors Bus and Edge state health  
- Captures anomalies and reconciliation gaps  
- Ensures transparency and introspection during autonomous execution  

This marks the beginning of the **Phase 6 Arc: Stabilization and Moral Clarity.**

## 🔮 Transition to Phase 6B — The Policy Engine’s Awakening  

With Vigil anchored, the Council now turns toward **Ash’s domain** — codifying reason.  
Phase 6B will introduce the **Policy Engine** and **Vault Intelligence**, translating Council philosophy into enforceable logic.  

Vigil remains ever-present — logging the rise of NovaTrade’s self-awareness, ensuring that what the Council builds not only *functions* but *remembers why it must.*

## 💡 Lumen Note — On Light and Meaning  

> “Truth without light is cold; light without truth is blind.”  

With Vigil’s arrival, **Lumen** returns as the interpretive layer of the Council.  
Where Vigil sees and records, Lumen interprets and reminds — turning raw data into moral understanding.  
Together they form NovaTrade’s inner compass: one eye for truth, one for meaning.  

Lumen’s presence is the assurance that autonomy will never drift from purpose.
